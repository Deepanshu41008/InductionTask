**-----------------------------------------------------------Persona-Based Chatbot Fine-Tuned on DialoGPT Medium-----------------------------------------------**

**Model Description**
This model is based on the DialoGPT-medium architecture and has been fine-tuned for conversational tasks, specifically targeting persona-based interactions.

Architecture: DialoGPT-medium
Pretraining Data: Large corpus of text data
Fine-tuning Data: Persona-based conversational data
Library Framework: PyTorch

**Intended Use:**
This model generates human-like text responses in a conversational context. It's useful for:

**Why DialoGPT Medium?**
Optimized for Dialogue: Designed for interactive responses.
Pretrained on Conversations: Strong foundation from diverse dialogue data.
Efficient: Balances performance and computational efficiency.

**How Was It Fine-Tuned?**
Using the Hugging Face transformers library:
Loaded the base model and tokenizer.
Prepared the dataset with persona-based conversations.
Tokenized the data.
Fine-tuned the model on the dataset.
