Fine-Tuning DialoGPT for Persona Based Chatbot
Chosen LLM
I choose DialoGPT-medium for this project. DialoGPT is a variant of  GPT-2 which has been fine tuned for dialogue generation tasks and thus is very good at producing  coherent and contextually relevant responses in conversational settings.

Chosen Fine Tuning Method
I fine  tuned the model using the Hugging Face transformers library, which is a library that provides state of the  art tools for training and deploying language models such as DialoGPT. The steps involved include loading  and the preparing Trainer the class.

Justifications
Model dataset, Selection: tokenizing This the paper input chooses text, DialoGPT setting because up it training is arguments  and training the model using  specially optimized for dialogue based tasks for building a persona based chatbot.
Fine Tuning Framework:  Hugging Face's transformers library is robust, flexible and widely adopted in the NLP community. It  simplifies the process of fine tuning large language models.
Training Strategy: I used a set of strategic  hyperparameters to secure performance and training time, including gradient accumulation, mixed precision training, and a cosine learning  rate schedule.
