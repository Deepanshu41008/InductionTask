Model Description
The model is based on the DialoGPT architecture and has been fine-tuned for conversational tasks, specifically targeting persona-based interactions.

Architecture: DialoGPT-medium
Pretraining Data: The original model was pretrained on a large corpus of text data.
Fine-tuning Data: This model was fine-tuned on persona-based conversational data.
Library Framework: PyTorch
Model: DialoGPT-medium
Intended Use
This model is designed to generate human-like text responses in a conversational context. It can be used for chatbot systems, virtual assistants, or other AI-based interaction applications.

Choice of LLM
We have selected DialoGPT-medium for this project due to the following reasons:

Optimized for Dialogue Generation: DialoGPT is specifically designed for conversational purposes, making it ideal for generating interactive and dynamic responses.
Pretrained on Conversational Data: The base model is pretrained on a diverse range of dialogues, providing a strong foundation for persona-based interactions.
Size and Efficiency: DialoGPT-medium offers a good balance between model size and performance, allowing for efficient fine-tuning and deployment without extensive computational resources.
Choice of Fine-Tuning Method
The model was fine-tuned using the standard approach provided by the Hugging Face transformers library. This method involves:

Loading the Base Model and Tokenizer: Utilizing DialoGPT-medium as the starting point.
Dataset Preparation: Preparing a dataset that includes persona-based conversational data.
Tokenization: Tokenizing the input data to be compatible with the model.
Training: Fine-tuning the model on the prepared dataset using the Trainer class from the transformers library with appropriate training arguments.
Justifications
Specialized for Conversational AI: DialoGPT is tailored for dialogue generation, making it the most suitable candidate for a chatbot that needs to adhere to specific personas during interactions.
Robust Library: The Hugging Face transformers library provides a robust and flexible framework for both loading pretrained models and fine-tuning them on custom datasets. It simplifies the fine-tuning process with its high-level APIs.
Resource Management: DialoGPT-medium strikes a balance between model capabilities and computational efficiency, ensuring that the fine-tuning process and subsequent deployments are manageable even on limited hardware.
