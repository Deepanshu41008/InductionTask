Details of Each File
data/
train.txt and eval.txt
These files contain the training and evaluation datasets respectively. Each file includes formatted data points used for model training and evaluation.

models/
dcgan.py
This script contains the implementation of the DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) model architecture.

scripts/
data_loading.py
This script provides functions for loading and preprocessing the dataset. It includes transformations and data augmentation techniques to prepare the data for training.

fine_tuning.py
This script focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained models on custom datasets. It includes code for setting up the training loop, loss calculation, and optimization.

inference.py
This script contains code for running inference using the fine-tuned models. It allows you to input new data and get predictions from the trained model.

notebooks/
Experiments.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook contains various experiments and analysis conducted during model training and evaluation. It includes visualizations and results for better understanding.
